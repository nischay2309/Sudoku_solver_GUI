# Sudoku_solver_GUI
This code helps visualise backtracking algorithm and solves any sudoku puzzle using python and pygame. 
The repository contains 2 python codes,
1. GUI_solver - This code is a visualisation tool as well as a working sudoku game in which the code tells us if the user input is valid or not, it will also add the number if it is valid on that location. 
2. non-GUI_solver - This code is just a sudoku solver without 'backtracking algorithm visualisation' to solve the sudoku puzzle faster. 

NOTE - This code only works for solvable sudoku puzzle.
